      to the next.

CrossOver Linux 13.0.0 - 2013/11/12


* Games Support:

  o CrossOver 13 has our new Performance Enhanced Graphics. Games will run
    faster, with higher frame rates! This is a major overhaul of the 3D

    'i386' specifier. This is purely a cosmetic change in the filenames we ship
    - some customers were confused, believing they needed a different installer
    for 64-bit machines, which is not true after the switch to multiarch.
  o Files saved with Microsoft Office are no longer marked as 'executable,'
    meaning they can be opened by clicking on them in Nautilus or other file
    browsers.

CrossOver Linux 12.1.1 - 2013/01/25


* This is a Mac OS X-only release.


CrossOver Linux 12.1.0 - 2013/01/23


* CrossOver:

  o CrossOver no longer ships Wine-Mono, an open-source replacement for .Net,
    by default. We had started doing this for CrossOver 12 but the large
    increase in download size and disk space usage proved too much. CrossOver
    can still download and install Wine-Mono on an as-needed basis.
  o We have fixed a bug which caused CrossOver to print unnecessary error
    messages when launching Windows applications, complaining that certain icon
    files could not be found.
  o New translations for Polish, Chinese (China), and a partial translation for
    Italian.

* Linux:

  o Running Guild Wars 2 on Ubuntu 12.04 with CrossOver 12 triggered a bug in
    the Compiz window manager which caused a CPU spike. We have added a
    registry key which can be used to disable the feature which caused Guild
    Wars 2 to trigger this bug, thus making the game playable with Compiz on
    Ubuntu.

    some programs.

CrossOver Linux 12.0.0 - 2012/12/12


* Linux:

  o CrossOver Linux now installs a single desktop menu item rather than a
    multitude of desktop menus. This approach works better with desktop systems
    such as GNOME 3 and Unity, which usually don't have a hierarchical desktop
    menu structure.
  o CrossOver now has much better support for window transparency (layered
    windows) when a compositing window manager is available. (When the Mac
    Driver is complete, this feature will be available on OS X as well). Many
    transparent windows will now work that did not before. Improvements in this
    area include:

    # Microsoft Office applications in the Office 2003 and Office 2007 suites
      will now behave properly when working with embedded pictures or graphics.
      Previously, rotating or resizing embedded graphics caused the screen to
      go temporarily black;
    # Game launchers (such as that for Guild Wars 2, for example) which use
      color-keying to create transparent window areas will display properly
      rather than being drawn with black borders; ...and many more.

  o We have resolved some issues which caused printers not to appear.

* Application Support:

  o CrossOver now supports World of Tanks.
  o CrossOver now supports Quicken 2013.
  o CrossOver now supports installation of .Net 4.0.
  o CrossOver Linux now supports Guild Wars 2. Guild Wars 2 will run for many
    people on CrossOver Mac, but many users will encounter persistent graphics
    problems. Previously, CodeWeavers had released a specially-built version of
    CrossOver dedicated to running Guild Wars 2. That is no longer necessary.
  o Improvements to Microsoft Office:

    # Fixed a crash displaying certain email messages in Outlook 2010.
    # Outlook 2010 will now save passwords.
    # Improved Gmail and other IMAP connections with Outlook 2007.
    # Fixed auto-discovery during account configuration for Outlook 2007.
    # PowerPoint 2010 now displays equations in slide shows.
    # PowerPoint 2010 no longer displays blank slides.
    # Fixed bugs in Word 2010 which caused the equation editor to be missing
      structures and formulas.
    # Fixed a bug in Word 2010 related to footnote style choices.
    # Project 2007 and 2010 can now edit dates for recurring tasks.
    # Fixed a crash in Project 2010 when filtering by resource name.
    # Visio 2002 can now search for new shapes.
    # Visio 2010 now displays properly when multiple shapes are open.

  o Star Trek Online is now faster during game updates.

    controls.
  o CrossOver now comes bundled with the Wine-Mono package, an alternative
    implementation of the .Net API.
  o CrossOver now implements Raw Input, the set of APIs used for mouse input by
    games like Guild Wars 2, World of Tanks, and others.
  o Support for printing on a variety of paper sizes has been improved.
  o DirectSound has a new resampler, for higher quality audio.
  o CrossOver now has sub-pixel font anti-aliasing.



CrossOver Linux 11.3.1 - 2012/11/05


* Linux:

  o Complete translations for:

    # Czech,
    # Spanish,
    # Japanese,
    # Lithuanian,
    # Polish,
    # Portuguese (Brazil),
    # Swedish, and
    # Chinese (China).

  o Fix a bug on Ubuntu 12.04 where Excel files would fail to launch.

* Note:to Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 users: CrossOver 11.3.0 is the last
  version of CrossOver which will work with RHEL5. The X11 libraries in RHEL5
  are sufficiently old that future versions of CrossOver will not work in

  of CrossOver.

      default).

    including Arch Linux.

    problem only.



CrossOver Linux 11.0.1 - 2012/03/20


* CrossOver Mac:

    period. Note that single-user registration was unaffected.

CrossOver Linux 6.0.0 - 2007/01/08


* Application fixes:

  o Added support for Flash Player 9.
  o Major improvements in Outlook behavior; except for composing HTML mail, it
    seems to perform basic functions well (and installing Word or Internet
    Explorer will make HTML composition work).
  o Improved the installation and operation of Internet Explorer. If installed
    in a Windows 98 bottle, it should work much better than it did before.
  o Improved installation of Quicken. All versions but Quicken 2007 should be
    usable now. Quicken 2007 is partially usable but has some issues with
    rendering and online integration.
  o Fix a bug with Remedy.
  o Extensive improvements in the handling of QuickTime 6.5 and 7.
  o Many miscellaneous bug fixes.

* Major improvements for games:

* General CrossOver fixes and improvements:

  o CrossOver is now much better at creating program icons that work and have
    the correct icons.
  o Added a Windows XP bottle template, which is useful for some unsupported
    applications.
  o Improved handling of CD detection and ejection. Installers that require
    multiple CDs should now install more graciously.



CrossOver Office 5.0.3 - 2006/06/22


* Major changes (since 5.0.1):

  o Fix the 'no-execute' and SELinux compatibility issues that happen on recent
    Fedora Core 4 and Fedora Core 5 distributions.
  o If ClamAV is installed, then CrossOver's wine script will now scan
    executables and attachments before running them. This should not be seen as
    an ironclad antivirus shield but as one more step to prevent accidental
    infection through CrossOver's associations.
  o Make it possible to upgrade bottle RPMs. Many other bottle RPM fixes and
    improvements.
  o Added support for repackaging an existing CrossOver installation as an RPM
    for distributing site-specific customizations.
  o Add support for side-by-side installation of multiple versions of the Loki,
    RPM and Solaris packages.
  o Added a Polish translation (thanks go to Mandriva Poland).
  o Updated the Portuguese translation (thanks go to JosÃ© Melo).
  o Updated the Japanese translation (thanks go to Takeshi KOUNO).

* Application fixes:

  o Fixed iPod support.
  o Fixed an authentication issue which should let iTunes access the Music
    Store again.
  o Work around an Internet Explorer 6 installer bug which causes it to
    complain about the 'download information' being 'damaged', including on
    Windows. The workaround should make this condition less likely.
  o Fix some copy and paste failures in Word 2003 and Excel 2003.
  o Fixed a number of crashes in PowerPoint 2003.
  o Fixed some scrolling issues in FrameMaker.
  o Fixed regression when installing the Microsoft JVM.
  o Fixed a crash which occurred when printing some large documents.
  o Fixed most sticky Alt key issues.

* Server Edition changes:

  o Added full bottle support.
  o Each client can connect to multiple servers, one per bottle.
  o Added Netscape plugin support (but only on the server, not on the clients).

* Desktop menu fixes:

  o Work around a KDE 3.5.1 bug so the 'Windows Applications' menu is visible
    on SUSE 10.1.
  o Work around a KDE 3.5.1 and 3.5.2 bug so the CrossOver associations appear
    in the 'Open with...' list. This fixes recent Fedora Core 5 versions, SUSE
    10.1 and Ubuntu 6.06.
  o Work around a Mandriva 2006.0 bug so '&amp;' and ';' won't break all the
    menus.
  o Fix menu duplication issue for root installs on Mandriva 2006.0.
  o Fix menu duplication issue on Debian 3.1, Mandrake 10.1 and others.
  o Fix menus on SUSE 9.0.
  o Avoid creating icons on GNOME's legacy desktop. This means users of modern
    GNOME should no longer get the annoying 'Link To Old Desktop' icon.
  o Fix handling of KDE's desktop icons for root installs.
  o Improve handling of the Windows 2000 menus. Installing an unsupported
    application in a Windows 2000 bottle should now always result in the
    creation of the corresponding menus.

* Desktop association fixes:

  o Make associations work with email tools that create temporary files with no
    extension. Strictly check the extension against the association's MIME
    type.
  o Fixed XDG associations so that they now work with Evolution.
  o Work around a Mozilla bug to make the associations work again in that
    browser.
  o More Excel association fixes.
  o Add aliases for the PowerPoint MIME types. This should stop PowerPoint
    associations from being ignored on some systems.
  o Ignore bad MIME types used by some Windows applications so their
    associations can be exported anyway.
  o Fix a bug which caused garbage to be put in the description of a couple of
    rarely used Internet Explorer MIME types.
  o Rename 'alternate associations' to 'alternative associations' for more
    clarity.

* General CrossOver fixes:

  o The CrossOver RPM packages now minimize the 'rpm --verify' output and
    correctly identify documentation files.
  o Fixed some issues with spaces in the bottle names, especially with managed
    bottles.
  o Improved the default browser detection in GNOME and KDE.
  o Improved the Windows Application CD detection.
  o Improved cxreset so it catches all hung Wine processes.
  o Improved support for CD-ROMs that are auto-mounted by means of Supermount
    (Mandriva), Subfs (SUSE) or HAL (recent distributions). In practice this
    means CrossOver Setup should no longer get into a loop trying to fix your
    CD-ROM configuration over and over again.
  o Made it easier to install multi-CD applications on Supermount systems.
  o Improved CrossOver's cxsu tool which is used to run commands as root so it
    automatically knows when to use sudo (e.g. on Ubuntu) and when to use su.
  o Fix the conversion of icons to PNG format. This should avoid some xpmtoppm
    error messages.

    now install with CrossOver.
  o Support for virtual Windows environments running either in traditional
    Windows 98 compatibility or for environments supporting Windows 2000/XP.

    Windows environments simply and easily. This allows you to segregate
    applications into different environments (aka 'bottles') to simplify
    testing and to improve stability. Bottles can be backed up, archived, and
    restored, and bottles can be deployed via RPM, making the process of
    deploying a Windows application as simple as pushing an RPM around.
  o Plugin support for 64-bit browsers.

      reduced. COM / MSI implementation, which now enables CrossOver to install
      a far wider range of applications.

    # Many, many other improvements.




CrossOver Office 4.2.3 - 2005/07/21

* Support for Microsoft Project 2000.
* Support for Microsoft Outlook XP.
* Made Remedy usable.
* CrossOver now detects Exec Shield and Prelink systems and offers to disable
  Exec Shield since it interferes with Windows Applications. This should be
  especially useful for Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux users.

    many other issues in Internet Explorer.
  o Associating a file type, like PDF files, with a Unix application, like
    Acrobat Reader, now works in Internet Explorer too.
